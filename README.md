# Top-Football-Scorers-2016-2020
I manipulated a dataset of  top goal scorers  from 28 Leagues amongst  9 different countries using Python Pandas. 
Also, I uploaded the csv data into PowerBi, and created visualizations that illustrate the amount of goals scored by each country and league, and the amount of goals
per player, and allows users to choose league and player.
